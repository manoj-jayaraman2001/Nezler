      <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
      <p>
        SEO, or search engine optimization, is the process of optimizing a
        website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for
        specific keywords or phrases. In other words, it involves optimizing a
        website's content, structure, and user experience to improve its
        visibility and relevance to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
      </p>

      <h2>
        There are a number of reasons why SEO is an important digital marketing
        strategy, including:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Increased visibility: With more than 3.5 billion searches conducted on
          Google every day, ranking higher in search results can significantly
          increase the visibility of your website. This can lead to more
          traffic, more leads, and more conversions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved user experience: Search engines reward websites that provide
          a great user experience, which includes factors like page load speed,
          mobile responsiveness, and easy navigation. By optimizing your website
          for SEO, you can also improve the user experience for your visitors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Higher credibility: Websites that appear at the top of search results
          are often seen as more credible and authoritative by users. This can
          help build trust in your brand and increase your credibility in the
          eyes of potential customers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cost-effective: Unlike other forms of digital marketing like paid
          advertising, SEO can be a cost-effective way to drive traffic to your
          website over the long-term. While it may require an initial investment
          in terms of time and resources, the results of SEO can continue to pay
          dividends for months or even years to come.

          Long-term strategy: SEO is a long-term digital marketing strategy that
          can continue to deliver results over time. Unlike other forms of
          marketing that may only have a short-term impact, the benefits of SEO
          can continue to accumulate as your website gains more authority and
          relevance in the eyes of search engines.
